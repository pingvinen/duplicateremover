=================

Very small and very simple tool that reads all characters from a given file and outputs each character 1 time - i.e. if "d" exists multiple times it will only be output 1 time.

This tool was created while creating a regular expression that had to match a very long (100+ kb) text. I was missing a character in my character class specification. This tool helped me :)
